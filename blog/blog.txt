I worked at Dell for a 1 year and 7 months but like all good things
            my time there came to an end. Due to workforce reductions I got laid
            off in Feb 2025. It came as a surprise to me, but that is the best
            thing that could have happened to me. I am now in a much better
            place technically, and am finding more about what I am good at. As
            much as I liked Dell, I think I entered without having an idea of
            what I wanted to do with my skillset. Regardless of the layoff, I
            still enjoyed my time at Dell. I got to meet many different people
            with whom I shared some warm memories.
