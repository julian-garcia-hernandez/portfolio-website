            &emsp;I built features for Dell's
            <a href="https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-us">
              self-support website</a
            >; a website customers used to troubleshoot their devices.<br />
            &emsp;I fixed front end issues. It was always some accessibility
            issue that I needed to fix for a specific user agent. Other days I
            wrote unit tests for my colleagues' code.<br />
            &emsp;I used ASP.NET MVC to build features for our products. We used
            Gitlab for version control, Jira for product management, and Agile
            for workflow.
            <br />
            &emsp;My biggest strength is establishing relationships in person.
            Leaving impressions was easier in person than over Teams.
            Thankfully, Dell held two conferences that I got to attend. I
            networked with many lovely folks. <br />
            &emsp;My weakness is overspecification, I sometimes get lost in the
            smaller details rather than focusing on the bigger picture. However,
            I have been told that I notice small, but crucial details that would
            otherwise go unseen.
            <br />
            &emsp;The people at Dell made sure to tell me how I could reach my
            full potential. They hosted many developmental program for my peers
            and I to learn about networking, new technologies, and
            <br />
            &emsp;I worked there
            <strong>a year and seven months</strong>.<br />

            &emsp; When my team had to think of an idea for our senior design
            project, first we spent some time looking for problems in our
            environment. As CS students, we noticed many of our peers struggling
            to receive their grades on time. In an effort to address this issue,
            my team and I came up with OpenGrader.
            <br />
            &emsp; OpenGrader sought to reduce grading time. Essentially what
            that means is make it easier for TAs or professors to grade the
            large amount of assignments they receive. We started to think about
            how we would acheive this. That is when we came up with ideas for
            features like file test cases (a.k.a grading automation), inline
            commenting (student feedback), and multi-language support.
            <br />
            &emsp; My biggest contribution to the project was syntax
            highlighting, a feature meant to ease code readibility. I also
            worked on unit testing for the frontend. <br />
            &emsp; What I found the most challenging was learning the tools,
            languages and frameworks. In this project, I was introduced to
            Docker, Next.js and Go for the first time. It was somewhat
            overwhelming to learn various things at the same time, especially
            while trying to build something, but I managed to contribute
            something useful to the project.<br />
            &emsp; Granted, I really enjoyed working on OpenGrader. It helped me
            solidfy all the engineering principles that are super important:
            requirement gathering, design, implementation, and feedback.

            building software. My strength is front-end development. My career
            aspiration is to make websites for artists/creatives. I think its
            super cool make and share art so I would want to help artists do
            just that.<br />
