          <h4>Software Engineer</h4>
          <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
          <h5>By J.G HERNANDEZ</h5>
          <p>
            &emsp; I was employed at Dell for a year and seven months. During my
            time there, I worked in the Dell Self-Support team, the people who
            maintained the dell.com/support website. I was always assigned unit
            test stories, so that was what an average day for me was like. From
            time to time I would however, work on changes to the front-end, or
            make pitch decks to be seen by org leaders.
            <br />
            &emsp; As an engineer there I was expected to know the following
            technologies. I only the listed the ones I used often, namely
            ASP.NET Core MVC, Micrsoft Visual Studio, and Gitlab. The language
            of choice was C#.<br />
            &emsp; In the year and seven months that I was there I learned so
            much. I learned about corporate culture. I learned about shipping
            features. I even learned how to dance "Bye Bye Bye" by NSYNC. (a
            networking activity which I thought was pretty funny). <br />
            &emsp; Honestly, I could have not been given a better career
            introduction. It was a great experience to have worked as a software
            engineer for Dell.

          <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
          <h4>OpenGrader</h4>
          <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
          <h5>By J.G HERNANDEZ</h5>
          <p>
            &emsp; When my team had to think of an idea for our senior design
            project, first we spent some time looking for problems in our
            environment. As CS students, we noticed many of our peers struggling
            to receive their grades on time. In an effort to address this issue,
            my team and I came up with OpenGrader.
            <br />
            &emsp; OpenGrader sought to reduce grading time. Essentially what
            that means is make it easier for TAs or professors to grade the
            large amount of assignments they receive. We started to think about
            how we would acheive this. That is when we came up with ideas for
            features like file test cases (a.k.a grading automation), inline
            commenting (student feedback), and multi-language support.
            <br />
            &emsp; My biggest contribution to the project was syntax
            highlighting, a feature meant to ease code readibility. I also
            worked on unit testing for the frontend. <br />
            &emsp; What I found the most challenging was learning the tools,
            languages and frameworks. In this project, I was introduced to
            Docker, Next.js and Go for the first time. It was somewhat
            overwhelming to learn various things at the same time, especially
            while trying to build something, but I managed to contribute
            something useful to the project.<br />
            &emsp; Granted, I really enjoyed working on OpenGrader. It helped me
            solidfy all the engineering principles that are super important:
            requirement gathering, design, implementation, and feedback.

          <p>
            &emsp; A detail oriented person who enjoys building, creating, and
            design. I think its super cool to have something in your head one
            moment then then bring it to existence in the next. I actually think
            my strongest strength is creativity. <br />
            &emsp; However I do have some weaknesses as well. Sometimes I am as
            obsessive to the point where its a flaw sometimes. I like to pay
            close attention to details, but sacrificing time. That is why my
            preference is working with others who make up for that. In teamwork,
            I make sure I understand the shared vision first. Only then, do I
            contribute my work. In doing so, feedback is something I seek often.
