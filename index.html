          <h3>DELL TECHNOLOGIES</h3>
          <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
          <h4>Software Engineer</h4>
          <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
          <h5>By J.G HERNANDEZ</h5>
          <p>
            &emsp; I was employed at Dell for a year and seven months. When I
            was there, I worked in the Dell self-support team. We were
            responsible for maintaining the dell.com/support website, a
            self-service solution for any troublshooting needs a dell client may
            have. <br />
            &emsp; During my time there, I wore several hats. Some days I would
            get assigned to work on the frontend; do some changes to the layout
            of certain forms or fields. Other days I spent some time writing
            unit tests. It really just depended on what type of story I would
            get assigned to work on by my dev lead and product manager. <br />
            &emsp; The language of choice was C# and we used the ASP.NET MVC
            Framework to build our products. For version control, we used
            Gitlab, and for product management, Jira. We organized our using
            Agile Methodolgies. Communication was entirely over Microsoft Teams
            since all of our team was spread across different parts of the
            world.<br />
            &emsp; I think that my biggest strength in a role like this was
            establishing relationships in person. I find that its easier for me
            to leave an impression in the physical presence of another human
            being, as opposed to alone, very often without the physical
            representation of who I am. Sure there were cameras on the laptops,
            but many times people do not like turning them on. As a privacy
            freak myself, I completely understand that sentiment and do not feel
            super comfortable with a camera in my face. Luckily, Dell sponsored
            various conferences in which I got to meet and network with many
            wonderful people. That really made up for the majority of the time
            spent online.<br />
            &emsp; I think my biggest weakness in a role like this was getting
            over imposter syndrome. I just always felt like there was a skill
            gap of where I was, and where I needed to be. Not just technically,
            but also in terms of soft skills. I felt that my profeciency as a
            communicator was lacking. Prior to this job I thought that I was a
            good communicator, but being in those panels with cross functional
            teams was a humbling experience. I know now that I was being to hard
            on myself, and that there are other factors that come into play that
            determine my development; some of which I have no control over.
            <br />
            &emsp; What I loved the most about Dell was definitely the people. I
            made many work friends, and managed to meet with some highly
            intelligent people. My favorite part of having worked there was
            probably the work conferences, just because it was nice seeing each
            other in person. <br />
            &emsp; However, I did have some gripes with my time at Dell. I think
            not seeing the impact of my work greatly affected my job
            satisfaction. I think that if I knew and saw the effects of my work
            on individuals I would have been a little more happier during my
            time there. <br />
            &emsp; Overall though, I had a pretty good experience at Dell. It
            was a great introduction to my career and taught me how to be a
            professional.

          <h4>OpenGrader</h4>
          <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
          <h5>By J.G HERNANDEZ</h5>
          <p>
            &emsp; When my team had to think of an idea for our senior design
            project, first we spent some time looking for problems in our
            environment. As CS students, we noticed many of our peers struggling
            to receive their grades on time. In an effort to address this issue,
            my team and I came up with OpenGrader.
            <br />
            &emsp; OpenGrader sought to reduce grading time. Essentially what
            that means is make it easier for TAs or professors to grade the
            large amount of assignments they receive. We started to think about
            how we would acheive this. That is when we came up with ideas for
            features like file test cases (a.k.a grading automation), inline
            commenting (student feedback), and multi-language support.
            <br />
            &emsp; My biggest contribution to the project was syntax
            highlighting, a feature meant to ease code readibility. I also
            worked on unit testing for the frontend. <br />
            &emsp; What I found the most challenging was learning the tools,
            languages and frameworks. In this project, I was introduced to
            Docker, Next.js and Go for the first time. It was somewhat
            overwhelming to learn various things at the same time, especially
            while trying to build something, but I managed to contribute
            something useful to the project.<br />
            &emsp; Granted, I really enjoyed working on OpenGrader. It helped me
            solidfy all the engineering principles that are super important:
            requirement gathering, design, implementation, and feedback.

            &emsp; A detail oriented person who enjoys building, creating, and
            design. I think its super cool to have something in your head one
            moment then then bring it to existence in the next. I actually think
            my strongest strength is creativity. <br />
            &emsp; However I do have some weaknesses as well. Sometimes I am as
            obsessive to the point where its a flaw sometimes. I like to pay
            close attention to details, but sacrificing time. That is why my
            preference is working with others who make up for that. In teamwork,
            I make sure I understand the shared vision first. Only then, do I
            contribute my work. In doing so, feedback is something I seek often.
