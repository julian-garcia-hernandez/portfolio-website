          <h4>Software Engineer</h4>
          <div class="horizontal-line"></div>

          <p>
            &emsp; I was employed at Dell for a year and seven months. When I
            was there, I worked in the Dell self-support team. We were
            responsible for maintaining the dell.com/support website. This
            website helped customers troubleshoot their devices. I was almost
            always assigned unit testing stories, but would also work on changes
            to the front-end, from time to time. There were moments where I
            would prepare presentations for our teams work. These presentation
            were made for our org leaders to understand the effect of work on
            business needs.
            <br />
            &emsp; I was expected to know various technologies. The ones I used
            on a daily bases were ASP.NET Core MVC, Micrsoft Visual Studio, and
            Gitlab. The programming language of choice was C#.<br />
            &emsp; I learned so much as a software engineer. I learned about
            corporate culture. I learned about shipping features. I even learned
            how to dance "Bye Bye Bye" by NSYNC. (a networking activity which I
            thought was pretty funny). <br />
            &emsp; I honestly, could not have had a better experience at Dell.
            It was a great introduction to my career and taught me how to be a
            professional.

          <h3>OVER THE YEARS</h3>
          <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
          <h4>OpenGrader</h4>
          <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
          <h5>By J.G HERNANDEZ</h5>
          <p>
            &emsp; When my team had to think of an idea for our senior design
            project, first we spent some time looking for problems in our
            environment. As CS students, we noticed many of our peers struggling
            to receive their grades on time. In an effort to address this issue,
            my team and I came up with OpenGrader.
            <br />
            &emsp; OpenGrader sought to reduce grading time. Essentially what
            that means is make it easier for TAs or professors to grade the
            large amount of assignments they receive. We started to think about
            how we would acheive this. That is when we came up with ideas for
            features like file test cases (a.k.a grading automation), inline
            commenting (student feedback), and multi-language support.
            <br />
            &emsp; My biggest contribution to the project was syntax
            highlighting, a feature meant to ease code readibility. I also
            worked on unit testing for the frontend. <br />
            &emsp; What I found the most challenging was learning the tools,
            languages and frameworks. In this project, I was introduced to
            Docker, Next.js and Go for the first time. It was somewhat
            overwhelming to learn various things at the same time, especially
            while trying to build something, but I managed to contribute
            something useful to the project.<br />
            &emsp; Granted, I really enjoyed working on OpenGrader. It helped me
            solidfy all the engineering principles that are super important:
            requirement gathering, design, implementation, and feedback.

            &emsp; A detail oriented person who enjoys building, creating, and
            design. I think its super cool to have something in your head one
            moment then then bring it to existence in the next. I actually think
            my strongest strength is creativity. <br />
            &emsp; However I do have some weaknesses as well. Sometimes I am as
            obsessive to the point where its a flaw sometimes. I like to pay
            close attention to details, but sacrificing time. That is why my
            preference is working with others who make up for that. In teamwork,
            I make sure I understand the shared vision first. Only then, do I
            contribute my work. In doing so, feedback is something I seek often.
